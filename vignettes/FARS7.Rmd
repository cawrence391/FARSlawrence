This package has functions which will read a fars csv file based on an input of a list of years, which will provide a dataframe from which a summary of accidents for a given year and month can be obtained, and which plots accidents on a map of US states based on inputs of a year and a state.

## Summary

Here is an example output of the `fars_summarize_years()` function which gives a aggregated view of the larger dataset

```{r, summary, echo = FALSE}
devtools::load_all(quiet = TRUE)
FARS::fars_summarize_years(2013)
```

## Map

The `fars_map_state()` function generates a plot showing the location of each incident in the defined year and state

```{r, map, echo=FALSE}
FARS::fars_map_state(1, 2013)
```
